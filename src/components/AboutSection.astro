		<h2>Designing experiences that feel effortless.</h2>
		<p>
			I partner with product teams to translate complex challenges into intuitive experiences. From research
			through delivery, I care about clarity, craft, and measurable outcomes that align with business goals.
		</p>
		<p>
			My focus has been on collaborative web and native products, shaping systems that scale while keeping the
			detail work grounded in empathy with users. I enjoy mentoring fellow designers, prototyping in code, and
			keeping interfaces calm even when the underlying logic is sprawling.
